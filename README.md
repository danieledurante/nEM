This repository refers to the paper  [Durante, D., Canale, A. and Rigon, T. (2018). *A nested expectation-maximization algorithm for latent class models with covariates* \[arXiv:1705.03864v5\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03864v5), where we propose a novel **nested EM** for improved maximum likelihood estimation of **latent class models with covariates**. The proposed **nested EM**  relies on a sequence of conditional expectation-maximizations which leverage the recently developed [Pòlya-gamma data augmentation](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.829001) for logistic regression to obtain simple and exact M-steps via generalized least squares. As we discuss in the paper, differently from current algorithms for latent class models with covariates, the proposed **nested EM** provides a monotone log-likelihood sequence, and allows improvements in maximization performance, according to empirical studies.

## Source code

The file [`LCA-Covariates-Algorithms.R`](https://github.com/danieledurante/nEM/blob/master/LCA-Covariates-Algorithms.R) contains the source functions for the implementation of the proposed **nested EM** (and an hybrid version of the **nested EM**), along with additional algorithms routinely considered in the estimation of **latent class models with covariates**. The source functions in [`LCA-Covariates-Algorithms.R`](https://github.com/danieledurante/nEM/blob/master/LCA-Covariates-Algorithms.R) require the `R` libraries `poLCA`, `dummies` and `nnet`.

## Empirical performance assessments

As we show in Section 3 of the paper [Durante, D., Canale, A. and Rigon, T. (2018). *A nested expectation-maximization algorithm for latent class models with covariates* \[arXiv:1705.03864v5\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03864v5), the **nested EM** provides improvements in maximization performance, compared to current algorithms. The analyses in Section 3 can be reproduced using the tutorial file [`Election-Data-Tutorial.md`](https://github.com/danieledurante/nEM/blob/master/Election-Data-Tutorial.md) which considers the analysis of the `election` dataset from the `R` library [`poLCA`](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v042i10), discussed in Section 3. The file [`Election-Data-Tutorial.md`](https://github.com/danieledurante/nEM/blob/master/Election-Data-Tutorial.md) contains also additional analyses and quantitative assessments not discussed in the paper.
